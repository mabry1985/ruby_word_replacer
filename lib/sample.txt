"Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand)" is a 1964 song written by Jeannie Seely and Randy Newman. It was recorded by Irma Thomas that same year and released as the B-side to "Time Is on My Side". It has come to prominence in recent years due to occasional appearances in the television series Black Mirror.

In his 2005 book Randy Newman's American Dreams, Kevin Courrier describes the song as one that "comfortably sits in that long pop - and blues - tradition of the sacrificial woman who stands by her no-good man" and describes Thomas's performance as one of "immaculate conviction that is both defiant and pained".[2]

The song peaked at number 2 on Billboard's Top TV Songs chart in 2018.[3]
